Cub3D
Cub3D is a project developed as part of the 42 curriculum, written in C. It introduces the basics of 3D rendering using raycasting, similar to the classic Wolfenstein 3D. The project focuses on rendering a 3D view from a 2D map using the raycasting algorithm, providing a first-person perspective in a simple 3D environment.

Features:
C Language: The project is fully implemented in C, ensuring efficient memory management and performance.
Raycasting algorithm: Simulates a 3D environment from a 2D map.
Texture Mapping: Walls and floors can be textured for a more immersive experience.
Keyboard Input: Navigate through the environment using keyboard controls.
Minimalistic Graphics Engine: Built using the MiniLibX graphics library, ensuring a lightweight and simple approach to 3D rendering.
The goal of Cub3D is to grasp fundamental concepts in computer graphics, including perspective, raycasting, and rendering optimization.
